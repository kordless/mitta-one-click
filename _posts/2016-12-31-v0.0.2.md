First update! This actually comes with rewriting most of the extension. It is now much more reliable. Before you could easily get the same spot of the page twice in the screenshot, and horizontal scrollbars on every frame as well. Most of those problems are gone now. There are still problems with absolutely positioned headers and sidebars, but that's a problem for another version.

Because I use one async function in this update, this version requires Chrome 55 or later. Firefox will support async functions in Firefox 52, so for now there's an extra wait of 500 ms at the very end of taking a screenshot.
