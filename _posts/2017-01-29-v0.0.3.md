This is just a minor update to show better errors when attempting to screenshot certain domains.

In Chrome, extensions can't inject scripts on the domain chrome.google.com. In Firefox, extensions can't inject scripts on certain mozilla.org domains. If you have a need to take screenshots on these domains, you can use the other browser to take them, i.e. use Firefox to take screenshot on chrome.google.com, and use Chrome on mozilla.org domains.

Thanks to this extension working in both browsers, you can still get what you want.
